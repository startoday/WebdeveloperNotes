1.API
application programming interface
interface for code/computers to talk to one another

IFTTT  connect APIs
programmableWeb -- search all kins of apis


2.when we use the internet, we make HTTP request and get HTML back.
API's don't respond with HTML, the structure information, API's respond with data, not structure
They use simpler data formats like XML and JSON

3. XML (extened markup language)
syntacticly similar to HTML, but it does not describe presentation like HTML does (strong, bold, stuff)
eg:
<person>
  <age>21</age>
  <name>King</name>
  <city>seattle</city>
</person>


4.JSON (javascript object notation)
JSON looks exactly like JS objects, but everything is a string
"key" :"val"
eg: (same infor as xml
{
"person" :{
    "age" : "21",
    "name" : "King",
    "city": "seattle"
    }
}
