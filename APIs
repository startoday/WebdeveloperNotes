1.API
application programming interface
interface for code/computers to talk to one another

IFTTT  connect APIs
programmableWeb -- search all kins of apis


2.when we use the internet, we make HTTP request and get HTML back.
API's don't respond with HTML, the structure information, API's respond with data, not structure
They use simpler data formats like XML and JSON (they are both format)

3. XML (extened markup language)
syntacticly similar to HTML, but it does not describe presentation like HTML does (strong, bold, stuff)
eg:
<person>
  <age>21</age>
  <name>King</name>
  <city>seattle</city>
</person>


4.JSON (javascript object notation)
JSON looks exactly like JS objects, but everything is a string
"key" :"val"
eg: (same infor as xml
{
"person" :{
    "age" : "21",
    "name" : "King",
    "city": "seattle"
    }
}

5. curl: to make request from the cmd line
make request of API use node
https://github.com/request/request

npm install request  //--not require


var request = require('request');
request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
  if(error){
	  console.log("some error");
	  console.log(error);
  } else {
	  if(response.statusCode == 200) {
		 console.log(body); //things worked!
	  }
  }
});  //404 is also a status code, 200 :OK
