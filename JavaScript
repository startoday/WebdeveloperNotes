1. five primitive data types
//Numbers -- don't care float or int or negative numvers 
4
9.3
-10
#math
1/3
0.3333333333333333
--remainder
10%3
1

//Strings  --- stuff inside " " 
"Hello World"
"43"
    //Single or Double quotes OK --but needs to match!
    "hello world"
    'hello world'

    //Concatenation -be in a one string
    "charlie" + "brown"  //"charliebrown"

    //Escape Characters start with "\"
    "Singin \"Do wah diddy, diddy, dum diddy do\" "
    "This is a backslash: \\"

    //Strings have a length property -- include all char(white space), no end '\n' stuff counted
    "hello world".length  //11

    //Access individual characters using [] and an index
    "hello"[0]  //"h"
    "hello"[4]  //"o"
 ##   5%3 (not 4!!!) -->2 
"hello".length % "hi\\".length

//Booleans
true
false

//null and undefined
null
undefined


2. right now just put ; at the end, later will talk about styles and conventions
//Variables are simply containers that store values
//They can store all of the values we've seen
var name = "Rusty";
var secretNumber = 73;
var isAdorable = true;
//Recall the stored value by calling the variable name
var name = "Rusty";
"hello there " + name    //"hello there Rusty"
var num = 37;
num + 3 + 10    //50
//We can change the stuff and type for var(dynamic type)
var name = "Robert";
name = "Bob";

#naming convenstion is camelCase

#The two other primitives are null and undefined

//undefined (just only declared)
var age
undefined

//null is "explicitly nothing"
var currentPlayer = "charlie";
currentPlayer = null;   //game over


3.built- in methods
//comments

clear(): clear the console
alert("some message")  # give you an annoying pop up!
console.log() #print sth to the console
prompt("give me some input") # ask input from user with a pop
    sayStuff = prompt("say");
    "hi"
    sayStuff
    "hi"
