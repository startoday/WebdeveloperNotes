1.what is node?
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
npm is node.js's package ecosystem, which is the largest one of open source libraries
--we can run js on the server side

2. to exit node: hit ctrl C twice
into node: type "node"
then you will have a similar javascript
but some won't work, such as alert(), document(), which are on the browser

run a file with node(use js in a console instead of a browser)
---node<filename>
