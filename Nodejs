1.what is node?
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
npm is node.js's package ecosystem, which is the largest one of open source libraries
--we can run js on the server side

2. to exit node: hit ctrl C twice
into node: type "node"
then you will have a similar javascript
but some won't work, such as alert(), document(), which are on the browser

run a file with node(use js in a console instead of a browser)
---node<filename>


3.Math.round(avg); will round depends on decimal instead of always chop the stuff

4.NPM
-is node.js's package ecosystem, which is the largest one of open source libraries
use npm install to install a package   npm install cat-me     -->node_modules/ will be created
use require() to include a package
var something = require("cat-me")  // call it: something()

5. difference between a library and a framework: inversion of control
you calls the library and a frame work calls you 

Express: a framework for web develop framework, light framework, you doing and seeing more seeings


6. in groome IDE
Option A: 
Change your app.listen code to look like this:

app.listen(3000, function() { 
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000'); 
});
Option B: 
Leave the app.listen code how Colt does it in the lecture, but start your app with this command: PORT=3000 node app.js


7.routes:
we listen to a port and respond the request
function(request,respons) ==>store the request made and respond sent
app.listen(process.env.PORT,process,env.IP);
//env stands for environment --not work for groom IDE, use the 3000 one

app.listen(process.env.PORT,process.env.IP, function(){
	console.log("server has started!");
});

8. --save
.json file is like a recipe to store all the info needed, not store all real needed stuff
use npm init to create a new package json -- put it in the folder you put app
use the -- save flag to install packages and save the dependency on json file

9.nodemon
auto matically restart your server when you change the server file( otherwise you need to ctlr C yourself)
just run nodemon instead of node app.js
use npm -i g nodemon   //first, i -install, g  global will search your files
the main file in your json file should be the app.js you want to run


10. wild card.. make sure this one will be the last! ,hold every else input
app.get("*",function(req, res){
	console.log("some one request to *!");
	res.send("you are start");
});


11.route parameters
app.get("/r/:subredditName");  ---not typing different things/branches a thousand times
app.get("/r/:subredditName/comments/:id/:title"); //respond also have the same pattern

put : on any variable

});

in the console: { subredditName: 'what', id: '1', title: '2341' }  --all strings
