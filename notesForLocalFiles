Instead of using Coltâ€™s app.listen() code in your apps, make sure to set it up like this:

var port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(port, function () {
  console.log("Server Has Started!");
});
Then, you will be able to preview your app by going into your browser and typing localhost:3000 in the address bar.
